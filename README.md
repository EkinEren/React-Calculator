This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

A simple calculator app made in reactjs. 

Currently has some issues in some browsers. Works fine on chrome. Will make it compatable with all browsers in next updates.

All logic is implemented, what's left is some css arrangements & compatibility issue.

That "lol" button there is a placeholder and does nothing when clicked.
